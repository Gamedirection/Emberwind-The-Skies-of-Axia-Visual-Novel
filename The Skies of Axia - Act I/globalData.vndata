It sits atop an ornate tower covered with detailed stonework at odds with the ramshackle slum surrounding it.":{"read":true},"Someone valued Gelspar at one point, but no longer. Today, anyone could use the intricate carvings as handholds and climb up to the hearth crystal to steal a shard.":{"read":true},"And that is why the crystal is failing.":{"read":true},"The crystal that once lit up the night like a beacon has been reduced to a dim glow that is becoming dangerously faint. Every day, locals brave or desperate enough climb the tower and steal slivers of the precious gem to turn a quick profit.":{"read":true},"When you're hungry enough, selling off tomorrow to get through today is an easy choice. But as the people of Gelspar chip away their one safeguard against the toxic air of Axia, they're accruing a debt they will never be able to repay.":{"read":true},"For generations, parents have regaled their children with tales of Adriel, the great City in the Sky. They say it is proof of humanity's ability to conquer the toxic miasma that has swallowed the world of Axia. The cloud utopia is a hub of learning, commerce, and culture more vibrant and diverse than any of the great, fallen empires.":{"read":true},"And so it is—for those in the upper reaches of then metropolis. Gelspar, on the other hand, is a dangling eyesore the rest of Adriel would prefer to forget.":{"read":true},"Fortunately, it's easier to get away with things when no one is looking, which is why you are on the way to Gelspar this evening.":{"read":true},"You have been instructed to meet at the foot of the Clueless Prince, the crumbling statue that stands guard over the Eastern Square between Gelspar and the Red Market. It used to depict one of the noble founders of the city, but vandals removed the head years ago.":{"read":true},"Time has eroded any other identifying features, and now his headless gaze is a symbol of Adriel's indifference to the district. The citizens above can't be bothered to fix anything below, not even in praise of one of their own.":{"read":true},"Today, the Prince's square is nothing more than a convenient meeting place, a no man's land between the two districts. Almost all the market stands that once filled the space have moved on. The few that remain are unlikely to stay for long.":{"read":true},"A woman flanked by two sentries with long spears emerges from the mist with a lantern held aloft and approaches the base of the statue. Both sentries have the Maddox emblem—a serpent coiled around the trunk of a large tree—etched into their breastplates.":{"read":true},"Welcome to Gelspar.":{"read":true},"My name is Elise. I work for Kendrick. And now, so do you, so I suggest you take a moment to become acquainted with each other.":{"read":true},"Laureat is Adriel's foremost scholar of hearth crystals. Once a bright young student with a promising career, she is haunted by a deadly accident that destroyed her reputation ten years ago.":{"read":true},"She has since channeled her grief into a relentless pursuit of knowledge, attacking her research with a single-minded focus that has distanced her from the rest of the scientific community. ":{"read":true},"Laureat has a profound faith in scientific inquiry, and is willing to do almost anything to gain access to the resources—and secrets—that have been denied her.":{"read":true},"One of the most promising young minds at the Academy of Sciences, Laureat spent years researching hearth crystals, combing through every book she could get her hands on. Sadly, every new piece of data convinced her that Adriel's body of information about crystals was woefully incomplete. She was driven to learn more, and was one of the first to enlist when the Academy organized a research expedition to the Silverglades.":{"read":true},"She was driven to learn more, and was one of the first to enlist when the Academy organized a research expedition to the Silverglades.":{"read":true},"The Silverglades is a separate island annexed by Adriel as part of the expansion for the growing metropolis.":{"read":true},"Unfortunately, the area proved to be dangerously inhospitable. Most of the settlers who went there were never heard from again, seemingly swallowed by the dense, mist-shrouded forests.":{"read":true},"People began to believe the land was cursed, and this notion was reinforced when they heard stories about uncanny wildlife in the region that was at once both familiar and foreign.":{"read":true},"Hoping to turn a costly investment into a profitable venture, the Council of Nobles asked the Academy to investigate the territory. Laureat leaped at the opportunity, confident that scientific inquiry would uncover the truth and dispel the superstitions.":{"read":true},"Within days of their arrival, the team discovered that the crystal shards in the Silverglades behaved unnaturally. Whereas normal shards had an almost magnetic charge that drew them together into a hearth crystal, the Silverglades version remained scattered and inert.":{"read":true},"Realizing that the mist was likely a diluted version of the miasma, the team spent several days gathering a cluster of shards, hoping it would offer greater protection to the camp and potential settlers.":{"read":true},"Their effort was effective, but it did not explain the strange phenomenon. Laureat was the first to theorize that the irregular hearth crystals might be related to the strange wildlife. Believing no area of inquiry to be off limits, she asked for permission to probe the shards with powerful arcane energies.":{"read":true},"Her efforts were encouraged, even though the dangers of tampering with hearth crystals were widely known.":{"read":true},"The experiment went terribly wrong. The lucky ones died in the explosion, but the rest were sickened and changed, becoming unrecognizable versions of their former selves. Laureat was the only true survivor, staggering back to Adriel while \n esperately clutching a single shard.":{"read":true},"Both the Academy and the scientific community at large quickly distanced themselves from her perceived incompetence. The Silverglades was officially condemned, the superstitions about it stronger than ever in the wake of the expedition's failure.":{"read":true},"Laureat, meanwhile, sought consolation in the deepest recesses of Adriel's libraries, studying hearth crystals with a renewed intensity. Her decade of research is finally starting to pay off. She is close to an explanation for the event that set her on this path.":{"read":true},"However, she needs a hearth crystal to test her hypothesis, and her involvement with the Silverglades disaster has made her a pariah to other academics and researchers.":{"read":true},"Ever resilient, Laureat has patiently waited for another opportunity to arise. The Maddox mission is a foolish and dangerous venture, but it will give her access to a powerful and whole crystal.":{"read":true},"She has volunteered her services in exchange for the chance to complete her life's work. As far as she is concerned, no risk could possibly outweigh the potential rewards, and nothing is off limits when it comes to the pursuit of knowledge.":{"read":true},"For travelling expenses,":{"read":true},"Elise tosses your group a small bag containing 10 gold pieces.":{"read":true},"You will find Kendrick at the Starlight Commons in the heart of Gelspar. He doesn't like to be kept waiting and it's a bit of a walk, so you'd better get going. Oh, and do try to stick together—that part of town can be dangerous.":{"read":true},"Elise begins walking toward the Red Market, but you sense something has been left unsaid. If you want to know more about Gelspar, this is your only opportunity to ask her. However, questions take time, and it seems that is a resource you cannot afford to waste.":{"read":true},"There's no point in delaying your trip with unnecessary questions. Elise is not likely to tell you anything you cannot learn from Kendrick.":{"read":true},"Elise turns a corner and disappears. Then you cross the bridge and leave the civilized part of the city. With any luck, it will be an uneventful trip.":{"read":true},"The streets of Gelspar are deserted as you approach the Hacksaw Bridge. Only a few sheets of metal separate you from the vast abyss below. To fall off Gelspar is to fall off the edge of the world. You don't even know if you would ever hit the ground.":{"read":true},"The bridge is a dilapidated structure of wood and sheet metal running between two of the larger vessels that make up the slum's core. In better days, a railing provided some degree of safety for the careless and clumsy. It has long since fallen away, exposing travellers to high winds and a precipitous drop that has claimed many drunkards.":{"read":true},"Rath has always been a man of many trades. Some know him as an information broker. Others know him as a smuggler. Those closest to him know him as a treasure hunter constantly searching for his next great adventure.

Rath spent countless hours listening to tales of Adriel, the magnificent city in the sky.":{"read":true},"He longed to traverse the toxic currents and see it for himself. When imagination could no longer satisfy his curiosity, Rath stowed away on a ship to seek his castle in the sky. That was forty years ago. He has not stopped moving since.":{"read":true},"Adriel, sadly, proved to be an enormous disappointment: a city teeming with bureaucracy, class conflict, and corruption. Still, there was plenty of room for an industrious individual living on the margins of the law, and Rath quickly became acquainted with the underworld.":{"read":true},"His deft hands and ability to avoid trouble caught the eye of Hobb, one of the criminal masterminds pulling strings in Adriel.":{"read":true},"Hobb was never directly involved in any crime; he was simply an information broker, a line of communication between buyers and sellers, and Rath was an excellent agent. His natural charms allowed him to move in many social circles and identify targets for Hobb's various criminal enterprises.":{"read":true},"The work has not made Rath wealthy, but it has given him plenty of opportunities to travel. Once business is settled, Rath seeks out local goods and curiosities that cannot be found in Adriel's public markets.":{"read":true},"Doing so has allowed him to maintain a steady side business as a popup merchant. No one has a better collection of trinkets, and his customers include people from all walks of life.":{"read":true},"The only item not for sale is his lucky charm: a twisted knot of metal roots encasing a complex assortment of gears. It is the one object that still perplexes him, and the only thing that is always on his person.":{"read":true},"His reputation also attracted the attention of Kendrick Maddox. The Merchant Baron needs someone who can come and go discreetly, ducking the legal red tape choking Adriel's official ports and avoiding the notice of those who would sabotage Kendrick's mission.":{"read":true}," As an experienced smuggler, Rath knows his way around an airship, and no one is better at navigating tricky situations.":{"read":true},"In exchange for Rath's services, Kendrick has agreed to provide him with credentials that will allow him to travel safely through the ports of Adriel.":{"read":true},"A passport would give him the freedom he has always craved, allowing him to go legitimate and explore the skies without always having to look over his shoulder for the authorities.":{"read":true},"But even more tantalizing is the opportunity to learn the answer to one of Adriel's greatest secrets.":{"read":true},"Hearth crystals are the most valuable objects in Axia, but few have any knowledge of their origins.

The beggars of Gelspar are pitiable, but they are not as innocent as they seem. You have a larger mission to take care of—best to concentrate on that. When you see Kendrick, please give him my regards.":{"read":true},"With that, Elise and her entourage head toward the Red Market. Their silhouettes vanish into the fog.":{"read":true},"With Elise gone, you realize there could be more to this area than garbage-strewn alleys and ramshackle buildings. Although she said you should be on your way, you might want to take a quick look around in case you can find something useful.":{"read":true},"A few haggard shopkeepers are packing up. While most are selling (mildly rotten) food, you notice one merchant peddling oils and elixirs from a battered cart.":{"read":true},"With nothing to hold your interest anymore, you set out for the Starlight Commons in Gelspar. If luck is still with you, it will be an uneventful journey.":{"read":true},"Even now, two bodies slump against a building next to the bridge, only a few feet from the edge.

Gasping for breath, she staggers toward you, arms outstretched.":{"read":true},"Please!\" she shrieks. \"Anyone! Help!":{"read":true},"The city does not stir. Her cries echo and die in the silent, indifferent streets. In Gelspar, sticking out one's neck is a good way to get it broken, and the courageous seldom live very long.":{"read":true},"A moment later, you see the creatures chasing her. Three large, misshapen hounds emerge from the shadows of the alley and stalk toward her.":{"read":true},"The woman stumbles halfway across the bridge, falling with a cry of pain. Her knee buckles as she attempts to stand.":{"read":true},"The three beasts close in on her from all sides, their hungry jaws gaping open to reveal massive, protruding fangs in front of serrated rows of teeth. They snap and snarl at the woman, but seem to be waiting for some kind of signal before moving in for the kill.":{"read":true},"A cowled man with a face painted like a skull steps into view on the opposite end of the bridge.

A skilled fighter, Rook has vowed to do everything in his power to protect the city he calls home.":{"read":true},"Rook grew up in Gelspar and, like most lowborn residents of Adriel, expected to spend the rest of his life toiling in the dark underbelly of the city. That was before fate intervened during a chance encounter with both the Chasers Guild and the Military Order.":{"read":true},"As the most prominent criminal organization in Adriel, the Chasers Guild regularly recruits members from Gelspar, taking advantage of desperate people searching for a way out of the district. Once somebody dons the white skull facepaint of a Chaser, there is no going back.":{"read":true},"Lucille, Rook's lifelong friend and an aspiring Chaser, was captured by the Military Order during a patrol intended to quell Chaser activity.":{"read":true},"Rook risked his life to protect her, and though he was no match for a squad of soldiers, his loyalty—as well as his willingness to put others before himself—caught the attention of Raya, the squad leader and the woman who would ultimately become\nhis mentor.":{"read":true},"Rook was offered a choice: receive due punishment for aiding and abetting a criminal syndicate, or enlist with the Military Order of Adriel. It was not a difficult decision.":{"read":true},"The nobles believe the people of Gelspar lack the moral backbone—and respect for authority—needed to thrive in the Order, so it was unusual for a person of Rook's status to be granted such an opportunity.":{"read":true},"Fortunately, he made the most of it. Armed with uncommon diligence and a wise mentor, he quashed the doubts and quickly achieved the rank of First Ensign, becoming a skilled soldier and a respected figure in the organization.":{"read":true},"Rook takes great pride in his achievements and is grateful to the Order that raised him from nothing and gave him a path to success. However, he has become increasingly aware that they serve those in power, upholding the inequality that keeps Gelspar's populace in despair.":{"read":true},"The Order's interest in the slum seldom extends beyond the Chasers, and its regular crackdowns are a method of control that punishes good people with few other options. As a result, Rook's sense of justice was not always aligned with his commitment to the law.":{"read":true},"He believed Gelspar deserved better, and that his duty was to serve all the people of Adriel, not just the nobility. Unable to reconcile his internal conflict, Rook left the service and returned to the rough streets of Gelspar, working as a mercenary while searching for a way to make a more substantial difference.":{"read":true},"That desire took on greater urgency once he learned of the gradual destruction of the hearth crystal supporting the district. Gelspar will soon succumb to the miasma, and there are whispers that the entire district could collapse as the crystal's power wanes.":{"read":true},"That's why Rook volunteered when word spread about the Maddox mission to acquire a new crystal.
